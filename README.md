**Spec2Cloud** is an AI-powered development workflow that transforms high-level product ideas into production-ready applications deployed on Azure—using specialized GitHub Copilot agents working together.

## 🎯 Overview

This repository provides a preconfigured development environment and agent-driven workflow that works in two directions:

- **Greenfield (Build New)**: Transform product ideas into deployed applications through structured specification-driven development

- **Greenfield (Shell-Based)**: Start from a predefined “shell” baseline and let coding agents translate natural language requirements to fill in the gaps via code.
   - https://github.com/EmeaAppGbb/shell-dotnet
   - https://github.com/EmeaAppGbb/agentic-shell-dotnet
   - https://github.com/EmeaAppGbb/agentic-shell-python



- **Brownfield (Document Existing + Modernize)**: Reverse engineer existing codebases into comprehensive product and technical documentation and optionally modernize codebases

Both workflows use specialized GitHub Copilot agents working together to maintain consistency, traceability, and best practices.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Use This Repository as a Template (Full Environment)

**Greenfield (New Project)**:
1. **Use this repo as a template** - Click "Use this template" to create your own GitHub repository
2. **Open in Dev Container** - Everything is preconfigured in `.devcontainer/`
3. **Describe your app idea** - The more specific, the better
4. **Follow the workflow** - Use the prompts to guide specialized agents through each phase

**Brownfield (Existing Codebase)**:
1. **Use this repo as a template** - Click "Use this template" to create your own GitHub repository
2. **copy your existing codebase** into the new repository
3. **Open in Dev Container** - Everything is preconfigured in `.devcontainer/`
4. **Run `/rev-eng`** - Reverse engineer codebase into specs and documentation
5. **Run `/modernize`** - (optional) Create modernization plan and tasks
6. **Run `/plan`** - (optional) Execute modernization tasks planned by the modernization agent

### Option 2: Install Into Existing Project using VSCode Extension
